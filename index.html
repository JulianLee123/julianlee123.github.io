			<h1 class="section-head"> Hi, I'm Julian Lee </h1>
			<p> I'm a rising Junior at Yale University pursuing a 4-year combined
			B.S./M.S. in Computer Science degree. I'm passionate about machine
			learning, and I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn new
			techniques and technologies while tackling impactful problems. Through
			research and summer internships at American Express and the Naval
			Research Laboratory, I have engineered machine learning solutions in
			areas including robotics, recycling, and secure software development.
			This work has led to the publication of 3 first-author papers. I'm
			excited to continue solving challenging problems in this rapidly growing field.

				<p>Big paragrah with a lot of text. Clustering is a powerful tool in
				exploratory data analysis that partitions a set of objects into clusters
				with the goal of maximizing the similarity of objects within each cluster.
				Due to the tendency of clustering algorithms to find suboptimal partitions
				of data, the approximation method Simulated Annealing (SA) has been used
				to search for near-optimal partitions. However, existing SA-based
				partitional clustering algorithms still settle to local optima. We propose
				a new SA-based clustering algorithm, the Simulated Annealing with Gaussian
				Mutation and Distortion Equalization algorithm (SAGMDE), which uses two
				perturbation methods to allow for both large and small perturbations in
				solutions. Our experiments on a diverse collection of data sets show that
				SAGMDE performs more consistently and yields better results than existing
				SA clustering algorithms in terms of cluster quality while maintaining a
				reasonable runtime. Finally, we use generative art as a visualization tool
				to compare various partitional clustering algorithms. </p>
